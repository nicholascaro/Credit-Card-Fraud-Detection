# Credit Card Fraud Detection
###### Summer Data Science Research Experience at Cal State Fullerton
###### Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda-Navigator
###### Built a classifier able to detect if a credit card transaction was fraudulent or not 	
###### Compared the sensitivity (true positive) rate of different classification models 	
###### Implemented Decision Tree with Gini and Entropy criteria, Random Forest, and Logical Regression models 	
###### Utilized Sklearn confusion matrix and NumPy pyplot to visualize models 	
###### Used Jupyter Notebooks to record and present my results
